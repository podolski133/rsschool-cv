My goal is to get a position as a programmer and develop in this field. My priorities are professional growth, gaining new knowledge and experience. I have the following strengths: responsibility, commitment, analytical mindset, ability to work in a team. I don't have any work experience yet, but I strive for self-development and learning new technologies.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Sample code:
```
    function greetUser() {
      var name = prompt("Please enter your name", "");
      if (name) {
          alert("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to our website!");
      } else {
          alert("Hello, stranger! Welcome to our website!");
      }
    }
    greetUser();
```
